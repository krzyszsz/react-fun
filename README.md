## Graphical effects in TypeScript.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/krzysztofjaniszewski0334/React-fun/_apis/build/status/krzyszsz.react-fun%20(1)?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/krzysztofjaniszewski0334/React-fun/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

Fire effect in TypeScript with React and Redux (plus a slider to change parameters of the fire).

My original idea was to follow the tutorial: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter but implementing my own components to play with. Apart from graphic effect there is my generic implementation of Binary Search with unit tests in TS (because why not).

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app react-fun --typescript

Later: configured CI with unit tests

Later: added sample module with binary search (using generics in TypeScript) with unit tests.

Later: added a simple animation component (a flame effect).

Later: played with state of components.

Installing Material-UI components to add slidebar: ( https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/ )

npm install @material-ui/core

npm install @material-ui/lab

Installing Redux:

npm install -S redux react-redux @types/react-redux
